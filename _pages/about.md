He is  currently an undergraduate student at East China Normal University (ECNU), majoring in Mathematics. My primary academic focus is on [singular perturbation](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%91%84%E5%8A%A8%E7%90%86%E8%AE%BA).


# Other Research Interests

He has a strong interest in Computer Science and Deep Learning. At present, I am working on projects that explore solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) using Deep Learning techniques, combined with numerical methods.

He has implemented various numerical methods in Python, and you can explore these projects on my GitHub homepage. In the future, I also plan to upload some mathematical notes to this site.

# Personal Life

He enjoys photography and will occasionally share some of the photos Iâ€™ve taken.
